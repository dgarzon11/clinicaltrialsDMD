Antisense therapy with the use of antisense oligonucleotides (AON) has the potential to restore effectively the production of dystrophin, the defective protein, in >70% of DMD. This could result in increased life expectancy through improved muscle survival and function. Recent scientific research has demonstrated the potential of this technique to skip mutated dystrophin exons, restore the reading frame and generate functional dystrophin protein. Having demonstrated proof-of-principle in human cell culture and animal model studies, we now intend to determine efficacy and safety of this approach to induce dystrophin exon skipping in children with DMD.
The specific aim of this phase I/II study is to assess efficacy (dystrophin production) and safety of intramuscular administered morpholino oligomer directed against exon 51 (AVI-4658 PMO). We are performing parallel preclinical studies to develop methods of systemic delivery that will be necessary for future phase II/III clinical studies.","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a fatal muscle degenerative disorder, arises from mutations in the dystrophin gene.

The study is based on the recent findings of an improved cardiac function in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy (Adamo et al 2010) and the previous findings of changed cognitive function in people with Becker dystrophy.
In muscular dystrophy, the cellular protein, dystrophin is affected. During normal conditions, the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which produce nitric oxide (NO), is attached to dystrophin. NO is important in normal vascular function in each of muscle, heart and brain by stimulating production of cyclic GMP. However, in muscular dystrophy with dystrophin deficiency, nNOS do not have the normal cellular anchor, resulting in decreased NO levels and subsequent reduced cyclic GMP production. Sildenafil inhibits degradation of cGMP thus prolonging and increasing a cGMP response. Such effects are the basis for use of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction.

The study is based on the recent findings of an improved cardiac function in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy (Adamo et al 2010) and the previous findings of changed cognitive function in people with Becker dystrophy.
In muscular dystrophy, the cellular protein, dystrophin is affected. During normal conditions, the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), which produce nitric oxide (NO), is attached to dystrophin. NO is important in normal vascular function in each of muscle, heart and brain by stimulating production of cyclic GMP. However, in muscular dystrophy with dystrophin deficiency, nNOS do not have the normal cellular anchor, resulting in decreased NO levels and subsequent reduced cyclic GMP production. Sildenafil inhibits degradation of cGMP thus prolonging and increasing a cGMP response. Such effects are the basis for use of sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension and erectile dysfunction. Current hypothesis: Sildenafil restores the cyclic GMP function affected in muscular dystrophy wit nNOS deficiency resulting in improved muscle, cardiac, cerebrovascular and cognitive function."

Consequently they do not have the strength to generate the minimum flow of 160 to 300 liters/minute for an efficient cough function. The restricted cough function allows secretion to accumulate, which in turn causes narrowing of the airway lumen and makes ventilation of the neuromuscular patient even more difficult. The patient's susceptibility to infection increases again and the vicious circle repeats itself. Severe secretion retention may even lead to ventilator failure. Effective secretion and cough management instead reduces the risk for stay in hospital. Therefore, secretion and cough management is a mandatory part of the therapeutic concept for treating patients with neuromuscular disease.
The therapeutic efficacy of the Lung Insufflation Assist Maneuver(LIA) integrated in the ventilator VENTIlogic LS-plus manufactured by Weinmann GmbH+Co KG was studied in a pilot study carried out by the Dep. for Pediatric Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine at the University Hospital of Essen/Germany in cooperation with Research & Development at Weinmann GmbH &Co KG, Germany . The objective of the pilot study was to examine the therapeutic efficacy of LIAM as a cough support function in patients with neuromuscular disease and indications for mechanical ventilation.
We hypothesized that i) a certain insufflation maneuver pressure may be optimal to achieve the highest individual peak cough flow and ii) that this pressure is below the pressure needed to achieve the maximum insufflation capacity. We define the lowest insufflation capacity at which the best individual PCF can be achieved as optimum insufflation capacity (OIC). The study was performed using two different techniques in order to demonstrate that findings are not dependent on maneuver details but are rather based on effects of maneuver pressure. The protocol was limited to techniques which do not require breath stacking: i) insufflation with an Intermittend Positive Pressure (IPPB) device and ii) with the VENTIlogic LS using LIAM.","Patients with underlying neuromuscular disorder (NMD) often suffer from weakness in the inspiratory and expiratory muscles. Consequently they do not have the strength to generate the minimum flow of 160 to 300 liters/minute for an efficient cough function. The restricted cough function allows secretion to accumulate, which in turn causes narrowing of the airway lumen and makes ventilation of the neuromuscular patient even more difficult. The patient's susceptibility to infection increases again and the vicious circle repeats itself. Severe secretion retention may even lead to ventilator failure. Effective secretion and cough management instead reduces the risk for stay in hospital.

Most of the burden of diarrheal disease is thought to be preventable with improvements in sanitation, water quality, and hygiene. Large scale interventions promoting these behaviours have either not been rigorously tested or have not produced sufficient change to warrant being rolled out at scale.
Research into the determinants of hand washing behaviour has identified disgust and shame as key motivators. Evidence supports the theory that disgust is a natural behavioural reaction to objects carrying disease risk, thus it may act as a key motivator for other health related behaviours such as water treatment. Whether this knowledge can be harnessed to increase the efficacy of hand washing and safe water campaigns in Bangladesh or elsewhere has yet to be rigorously tested.
The investigators will develop an intervention that utilizes disgust and shame eliciting messages to promote hand washing with soap and point of use water treatment in low income housing compounds of urban Dhaka. The investigators will test the efficacy of this intervention against a more traditional public health intervention based on increasing knowledge of health risks and germ transmission using a randomized controlled trial. The study sample will be broken into the following four arms.
1. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment
2. Standard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment & Hand Washing
3. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment
4. Disgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment & Hand
This design will allow us to compare outcomes for hand washing and water treatment between both standard public health interventions and disgust and shame based interventions as well as test the overall efficacy of the program comparing with the control. Data will be collected from all compounds at baseline, three month midline and at the six month endline giving us the practical and analytical benefits of a longitudinal dataset.
Compounds will participate in interactive, educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion meetings. For the Disgust and Shame group, these meetings will emphasize disgust and shame related to unsafe water and/or hygiene practices, whereas the Standard group's meetings will resemble a more typical public health intervention explaining the risks and methods of contamination.
At the first meeting, compounds will receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based chlorine dispenser model to treat their drinking water. A randomly selected half will also receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based handwashing station. At the end of the month, there will be a sales meeting in which the investigators will measure compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.
In assessing the impact of the interventions, the investigators are primarily interested in whether the prevalences of safe water and hygiene behaviours differ by treatment arm and over time. The best measurements for approximating behaviour prevalence are physical observations (presence of residual chlorine, hand cleanliness inspections), structured observation of behaviour, rapid physical observations (physical state of hardware/drinking water), self-report of water treatment and hand washing behaviour and willingness to pay for necessary products. The investigators will also attempt to measure and track changes in personal determinants of behaviour such as feelings of disgust and shame related to hand washing and water treatment behaviours.","An estimated 2.2 million children under the age of 5 years die from diarrheal disease each year.

We aim to determine the effect of CRT-D or CRT-P implantation in non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure patients.
The reason why we initiated this trial is the lack of evidence-based treatment for the significant number of these patients. In these patients, 5-year mortality remains as high as 20% despite recent therapeutic advances. Based on currently available evidence, because of a significant decrease in mortality due to modern pharmacotherapy, it is not certain which of these patients should receive a CRT-P and who should receive a CRT-D. No dedicated and adequately powered trial has addressed this important question.
We hypothesize that patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF â¤35%, without left ventricular mid-wall fibrosis on LGE-CMR, will not benefit from CRT-D implantation compared with CRT-P only implantation.
If our hypothesis is confirmed, this could provide evidence for the management of these patients with a significant impact on common daily praxis and health care expenditures.
We aim to enroll 600 patients in the trial. 924 patients are needed to be screened for these 600 patients to be randomized.
Patients with non-ischemic HF visiting an out-patient department and possibly eligible for the trial will have their pharmacotherapy optimized.
Patients with a significant amount of fibrosis will be excluded from the study and treated according to local practice with an emphasis on ICD implantation to prevent SCD.
After fulfilling all eligibility criteria, including maximally tolerated pharmacotherapy, subjects will be randomized by the physicians who enrolled them in a 1:1 ratio to receive CRT-D or CRT-P implantation.
All patients will be followed-up for at least 3 years after the implantation.","The ICD-Reality study is a non-commercial, investigator-led, multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

The recruitment of groups was carried out at the neuromuscular disease outpatient clinic of the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo (UNIFESP). The recruited individuals were divided into 4 groups, namely: DMD that used deflazacort (DMD-D); DMD that used Prednisone/Prednisolone (DMD-P); DMD Control with no corticoid use (DMD-C) and Controls with typical development (CTD). The protocol was applied during the evaluation that was carried out at outpatient follow-up visits.
To assess the functionality of each patient, the Vignos scales were used to characterize the sample and the Motor Function Measure (MFM) for association with HRV indices.
All heart rate records were performed using a cardiofrequencymeter (V800, Polar). After placing the brace and monitor, the individuals were placed in the supine position and remained at rest spontaneously breathing for 25 minutes. For HRV analysis, indexes obtained by linear methods, in the domain of time and frequency, and non-linear methods were used.","A cross-sectional study was carried out, in which 40 boys, aged 11 to 18 years, were evaluated.

There is no consensus on a standardized physiotherapy and rehabilitation program or exercise prescription in DMD. Motor imagery (MI) is defined as visualizing motor activities in one's mind without performing any movement. There are studies examining the effectiveness of motor imagery in stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson's, peripheral facial paralysis, and phantom pain. This study is aimed to examine the effect of motor imagery on gait and balance functions in children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Boys residing in Istanbul Turkey, between the ages of 5 and 12, with a diagnosis of DMD who have not lost their ability to ambulate independently will be included in the study. The included individuals will be divided into two groups due to randomization: Group A (Control Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program) and Group B (Additional Motor Imagery Training to Intervention Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program). While the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program is applied to the participants in Group A with 40-minute sessions on 2 non-consecutive days of the week for 8 weeks, the participants in Group B will receive an additional 25-30-minute motor imagery program to the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program. Participants were tested with Kinovea Gait Analysis, Timed Up and Go Test, 2 Minute Walking Test, Motor Function Rating Scale for Neuromuscular Diseases, timed performance tests, Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Pediatric Fear of Fall Questionnaire (Ped-FOF) before and after the program. will be evaluated later. IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) statistical program version 22.0 will be used for statistical analysis. The conformity of the variables to the normal distribution will be determined by the ""Shapiro-Wilk Test"". If the variables show normal distribution, the variation within the group will be analyzed with the ""Paired Sample T Test"", if not, the ""Wilcoxon Test"" will be analyzed. In the comparison between groups, if the variables show normal distribution, it will be done with the ""Independent T Test"" in independent groups and the ""Mann Whitney U Test"" if they do not show normal distribution. Categorical data distributions will be evaluated with the ""Chi-square test"". In all analyses, p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.","The most common muscular dystrophy among pediatric neuromuscular diseases is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).

This study is aimed to examine the effect of motor imagery on gait and balance functions in children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Boys residing in Istanbul Turkey, between the ages of 5 and 12, with a diagnosis of DMD who have not lost their ability to ambulate independently will be included in the study. The included individuals will be divided into two groups due to randomization: Group A (Control Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program) and Group B (Additional Motor Imagery Training to Intervention Group Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Program). While the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program is applied to the participants in Group A with 40-minute sessions on 2 non-consecutive days of the week for 8 weeks, the participants in Group B will receive an additional 25-30-minute motor imagery program to the physiotherapy and rehabilitation program. Participants were tested with Kinovea Gait Analysis, Timed Up and Go Test, 2 Minute Walking Test, Motor Function Rating Scale for Neuromuscular Diseases, timed performance tests, Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, Pediatric Fear of Fall Questionnaire (Ped-FOF) before and after the program. will be evaluated later. IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) statistical program version 22.0 will be used for statistical analysis. The conformity of the variables to the normal distribution will be determined by the ""Shapiro-Wilk Test"". If the variables show normal distribution, the variation within the group will be analyzed with the ""Paired Sample T Test"", if not, the ""Wilcoxon Test"" will be analyzed. In the comparison between groups, if the variables show normal distribution, it will be done with the ""Independent T Test"" in independent groups and the ""Mann Whitney U Test"" if they do not show normal distribution. Categorical data distributions will be evaluated with the ""Chi-square test"". In all analyses, p\<0.05 will be considered statistically significant."

Historically, these disorders are difficult to treat. In the last three decades, there is a great progress in molecular and genetic basis of these disorders; early diagnosis is achievable with proper clinical recognition and advanced genetic testing [1].
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular muscular X-linked recessive disorders that belong to a group of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that placed in the middle of short arm of X chromosome [2]. Mutation in this gene lead to absence of dystrophin or structural defects of this protein. The lack of functional dystrophin impairs the structure and function of myofibers which are essential for physiological growth of muscle tissue [3].
The non-dystrophic myopathies are a group of inherited myopathies defined by distinctive static histochemical and/or characteristic ultrastructural changes on muscle.
The nomenclature of dystrophic myopathies can be confusing as some of them are classified by age of onset of symptoms (e.g., congenital muscular dystrophies), whereas others are classified by distribution of weakness (e.g., limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, distal myopathies, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy), by characteristic clinical features (e.g., myotonic dystrophy), by the name of the causative gene (e.g., GNE-myopathy, dystrophinopathies), whereas others are named after the physician first describing the disease (i.e., Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy or Bethlem myopathy) or can be subdivided in an entirely different way (i.e., the subgroups of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies which were named according to their mode of inheritance and order of publication) ]4[ Several aspects need to be taken into account in order to establish a clinical diagnosis; these features include but are not limited to the severity of the muscular wasting, as well as its distribution, and the accompanying symptomology, biochemical, hematological, physical, and neurological investigations, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. Moreover, if the gene defect is established, diagnosis can also be confirmed by gene testing ]5[
Muscle biopsy lacks of typical dystrophic features such as increased conjunctive endomysial tissue, necrosis, and regeneration and shows one or more characteristic histological features. Based in pathological descriptions, the main non-dystrophic myopathies were described during the last century, taking into account the age of onset and the structural or ultrastructural markers [6].
Certain genes, in particular those with large sizes (TTN, RYR1, NEB), may present with different clinical and histological phenotypes and therefore their related myopathies be classified within different groups [7].
It is useful to know that other genetic myopathies may mimic non-dystrophic myopathies. This is the case of certain metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies that may show very selective muscle weakness. The description of these disorders goes beyond the scope of this chapter. However, it may be useful to take into account at least three examples, Pompe disease, the glycogen storage disorder type II (GSD II), and TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy, because they may present as congenital or later-onset non-dystrophic myopathies, may show particular muscle imaging abnormalities, and may be treatable [8; 9].
Understanding the clinical and molecular characteristics of non-DMD is crucial for several reasons. First, accurate diagnosis is essential for proper genetic counseling and family planning. Second, identification of the specific genetic mutation allows for the potential development of targeted therapies in the future. Finally, characterization of the clinical course of different non-DMD can guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.","Muscular Myopathies are a heterogenous group of inherited muscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness.

NCT06574919,2025-03-13 13:42:12.822282,2025-03-13 13:27:40.069939,Brief Summary,"Muscular Myopathies are a heterogenous group of inherited muscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Historically, these disorders are difficult to treat. In the last three decades, there is a great progress in molecular and genetic basis of these disorders; early diagnosis is achievable with proper clinical recognition and advanced genetic testing \[1\].
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular muscular X-linked recessive disorders that belong to a group of disorders known as dystrophinopathies. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene that placed in the middle of short arm of X chromosome \[2\]. Mutation in this gene lead to absence of dystrophin or structural defects of this protein. The lack of functional dystrophin impairs the structure and function of myofibers which are essential for physiological growth of muscle tissue \[3\].
The non-dystrophic myopathies are a group of inherited myopathies defined by distinctive static histochemical and/or characteristic ultrastructural changes on muscle.
The nomenclature of dystrophic myopathies can be confusing as some of them are classified by age of onset of symptoms (e.g., congenital muscular dystrophies), whereas others are classified by distribution of weakness (e.g., limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, distal myopathies, facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, and oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy), by characteristic clinical features (e.g., myotonic dystrophy), by the name of the causative gene (e.g., GNE-myopathy, dystrophinopathies), whereas others are named after the physician first describing the disease (i.e., Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy or Bethlem myopathy) or can be subdivided in an entirely different way (i.e., the subgroups of the limb-girdle muscular dystrophies which were named according to their mode of inheritance and order of publication) \]4\[ Several aspects need to be taken into account in order to establish a clinical diagnosis; these features include but are not limited to the severity of the muscular wasting, as well as its distribution, and the accompanying symptomology, biochemical, hematological, physical, and neurological investigations, electromyography, and muscle biopsy. Moreover, if the gene defect is established, diagnosis can also be confirmed by gene testing \]5\[
Muscle biopsy lacks of typical dystrophic features such as increased conjunctive endomysial tissue, necrosis, and regeneration and shows one or more characteristic histological features. Based in pathological descriptions, the main non-dystrophic myopathies were described during the last century, taking into account the age of onset and the structural or ultrastructural markers \[6\].
Certain genes, in particular those with large sizes (TTN, RYR1, NEB), may present with different clinical and histological phenotypes and therefore their related myopathies be classified within different groups \[7\].
It is useful to know that other genetic myopathies may mimic non-dystrophic myopathies. This is the case of certain metabolic and mitochondrial myopathies that may show very selective muscle weakness. The description of these disorders goes beyond the scope of this chapter. However, it may be useful to take into account at least three examples, Pompe disease, the glycogen storage disorder type II (GSD II), and TK2-related mitochondrial DNA depletion myopathy, because they may present as congenital or later-onset non-dystrophic myopathies, may show particular muscle imaging abnormalities, and may be treatable \[8; 9\].

Data on healthcare utilization and associated costs for DMD patients, particularly within the French healthcare context, remain limited.
